Google Code Prettify - Lang Latte

Created by Vaclav Bohac <bohac.v@gmail.com>.

This script enables syntax highlighting in a browser of Nette Framework's
Latte syntax (looks very similiar to Smarty).

For example visit http://wop.vlcovice.net/prettify-latte/.

This file is not complete syntax highlighting engine.
It's extension file for Google's Code Prettify,
see http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/.
